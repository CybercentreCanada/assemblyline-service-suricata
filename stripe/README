stripe v0.3c
Written by Foeh Mannay, January 2016

PURPOSE
=======

"stripe" is a tool which attempts to remove any and all encapsulating headers (i.e.
VLAN tags, MPLS shim headers, PPPoE, GRE, L2TP, GTP and VXLAN) from a pcap file, leaving
plain old payload over Ethernet. This is useful as some tools cannot work with
encapsulated frames and, until now, I couldn't find any automatic way to convert a pcap
with such headers into a usable format.

The nested IP fragment re-assembly support *seems* to be stable now and is at the point
where I can no longer find any pcap files that trip it up. Please feel free to contribute
any that you find!

This version of stripe adds VXLAN support on the two standard UDP ports (8472 and 4789).

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on the
theory behind this if you are interested.

INSTALLATION
============

For Linux / Mac / MinGW it should be possible to build from source using:

gcc -o stripe stripe.c

I will make some binaries available for convenience but I make no assurances that I will
keep them up to date.

USAGE
=====

There are only two parameters and both are mandatory. You must specify your
input capture file (original pcap format) with the -r flag and your output capture file
with the -w flag. Here's an example:

Harrys-MacBook-Air:stripe foeh$ ./stripe -r mpls-frames.cap -w clean-frames.cap

Parsing capfile...

4 frames processed.

CHANGE LOG
==========

v0.1a	First working release, tested with 802.1Q VLANs, MPLS, GRE and PPPoE. L2TP in 
development.

v0.2a	Added "experimental" GTP support, realised the need to pad small frames!

v0.3a	Added IP fragment reassembly support

v0.3b	Added VXLAN support

v0.3c	Fixed L2TPv2 support, which flat out didn't work up until now.
